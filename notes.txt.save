SDL has functions that can read a png image and display it into the screen

I wanted to use SDL mostly as a tool to give me a window  and handle as much of the graphics processing 
as I could by writting the c code myself

.ppm files, portable pixel map

I wanted to quickly be able to change the pixel output on the screen by opening the image 
file in a text editorand changing the RBG values myself

PNG is a bit more complcated for fast in file pixel manipulation
